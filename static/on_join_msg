Welcome, {}, to the Aeternium: Songs of Mire and Mortal Hubris Alpha Testing stage! Prepare to enter an epic sci-fi/fantasy universe the likes of which you've never seen before, where nearly every action you make will make a difference. 

Before you embark on your journey through Psalm, you should check out our #🌕『chat-rules』 and #🌕『roleplay-rules』. If you're feeling curious about the world, you can check out #🌕『world-info』  and #🌕『cosmology』! Our character sheet is located in #⚡『templates』, and last but not least, our main channel can be found in #🌟『banter』.

We understand that this is a lot to take in, so please, don't hesitate to ask any of our @༺༻༺♾AETERNALS♾༻༺༻ for help with anything. Information on how to go on adventures and things of that nature can be found in #🌕『how-to-play』, and if you need us, we're only a message away, so enjoy your stay!

And that rhyme. Enjoy that too.
