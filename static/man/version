ATHelper uses versioning numbers for me (the developer) to know what changes were made when.

A version could like like:

0.13.0-valentine
or
0.13.0-angela

*valentine* t the end of the version number denotes that its a testing version or an incomplete version not meant to be used in production.
*angela* at the end denotes that its a production version.
