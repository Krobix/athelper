If you get an error that looks like this:

```Error: there was an error with the command. That command may not exist or an argument you gave may be invalid.```

Then you most likely input the command wrong. You should consult the help page. Some common problems are syntax errors, especially forgetting quotes. Make sure that, if 
an argument you gave to a command gave multiple words, that you put them in quotes.
